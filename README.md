# c2c
Command and Control server that connects to a script on your target computer.
For optimal performance, host server use replit. My development server name is currently in the client_software script. After pasting all files and folders but client_software.py to a python repl, go into client_software and change the server names to your own- replit gives you a website when you use flask.

Note- project is still in development.
